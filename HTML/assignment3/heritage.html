    The site of Rakhigarh is one of the five known biggest townships of Harappan civilization on Indian sub-continent. Other four are Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Ganveriwala in Pakistan and Dholavira (Gujrat) in India. Five interconnected mounds spread in a huge area form the Rakhigarhi's unique site. Two mounds, out of five, were thickly populated. This site was excavated by Shri Amarendra Nath of Archeological Survey of India.

    The archaeological excavations revealed mature Harappan phase represented by planned township having mud-brick as well as burnt-brick houses with proper drainage system. The ceramic industry represented by red ware, which included dish-on-stand, vase, jar, bowl, beaker, perforated jar, goblet and handis. Animal sacrificial pit lined with mud brick and triangular and circular fire alters on the mud floor have also been excavated that signifiest the ritual system of Harappans. A cylindrical seal with five Harappan characters on one side and a symbol of an alligator on the other is an important find from this site.
    
    Other antiquities included blades; terracotta and shell bangles; beads of semiprecious stones, terracotta, shell and copper objects; animal figurines, toy cart frame and wheel of terracotta; bone points; inscribed steatite seals and sealings.
    
    The excavations have yielded a few extended burials, which certainly belong to a very late stage, may be the medieval times.

    This huge gate presents a beautiful example of Sultanate architecture. Out of the five gates of walled ancient city of Hansi, this is the only one that survives as an ancient structure. This ancient gateway was built by Sultan Alaud-din Khilji in 1303 AD as per the Persian inscription. It is a pointed arch gate. Subsequently, it was repaired in 1522 AD during the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi. This gateway, served in the ancient times as the main entrance to Hansi, is over 30 metres high.

<h2>Fort of Hansi</h2>
<div class="foh">
    <a href="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/Destination/fort-of-hansi"> <img src="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/WriteReadData/mediafiles/image/hisar6.jpg" alt="fort of hansi"></a>
    One of the oldest fort of Haryana was situated at Hansi. Though most of its walls and structures have now fallen, still some remains of that historical fort are surviving. This fort is more than 1,000 years old and the ancient fort was surviving till 1857, when its greater part was demolished. This building rests on 36 masonry pillars and arches with carved roofs. Now a huge 50 feet high mound is representing the ancient fort, all structures are on the top of the mound. It is a protect monument by Archeological Survey of India.

<h2>Feroz Shah Palace</h2>
<div class="fsp">
    <a href="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/Destination/feroz-shahs-palace-and-tahakhanas"> <img src="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/WriteReadData/mediafiles/image/firojshah_palace_7.jpg" alt="ferozshah palace"></a>
    The edifice known as Firoz Shah's Palace and tahkhana was built by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi (1351-1388 AD). The palace is built of rubble masonry covered with thick lime plaster. Its arches are supported on sandstone carved pillars possibly belonging to some Hindu temples. The palace complex consists of an open courtyard surrounded by two and three-storied structures. A passage with steps leading to the terrace is embedded in the massive western wall of the palace. This passage was most possibly meant for guarding the roofs of the palace. It has several bastions with hollow cores and has a pillared hall connected with other rooms and cells of the palace. The red sandstone structures on the eastern side of the palace and the lotus tank on the terrace, however, are of much later origin.

<h2>Fort of Prithvi Raj</h2>

    The Gujjari Mahal was built by Firoz Shah Tughlaq for his beloved Gujri Rani, a native of Hisar with whom he fell in love during the course of one of his hunting expeditions. The palace imbibes characteristic features of Tughlaq architecture such as massive tapering walls thickly plastered in lime and narrow openings. Open stairs lead to the baradari (pavilion) of the palace, which stands on a high plinth and has underground chambers. The baradari is a square structure having three developed arches on each side. All entrances (except one) are provided with stone doorframes. The roof has nine bays, each carrying hemispherical dome decorated with panelling work in lime plaster. The exterior walls above the arched openings are provided with beautifully carved red sandstone brackets.

<h2>Jahaj Kothi</h2>

    George Thomas, a native of Ireland and the uncrowned ruler of the territory between Sirsa and Rohtak built this building as his residence. Owing to its isolated location, it gives an impression of a ship in the ocean surrounded by a huge open area. A progressive distortion of the word 'George' to Jahaj over a period of time brought a new name to the place.

    After the defeat of George somewhere in the first decade of 19th century, James Skinner, a respected name in the service of British Government, became the ruler of this territory. He also used 'Jahaj Kothi' for some time as his residence before constructing his own palace at Hansi. This monument is a good example of pre-British architecture in the transitory phase.

<h2>Ruined Quilla</h2>
<div class="rq">
    <a href="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/Destination/ruined-qila"> <img src="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/WriteReadData/mediafiles/image/ruined_quila_1.jpg" alt="ruined quilla"></a>
    This is populary known as the fort or quila mound, most possibly represents the ruins of a fort and settlement which is ascribed to Prithviraj Chauhan. It was later destroyed by Muhammad of Ghor. Subsequently, some Muslim and Hindu shrines were built over the ruins of the fort from time to time. In 1982, 57 Jain bronze images were also discovered from the ruins of the fort. This site was excavated by Shri D.B. Sharma of Archaeological Survey of India.

<h2>Lat Ki Masjid</h2>
<div class="lkm">
    <a href="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/Destination/lat-ki-masjid"> <img src="https://haryanatourism.gov.in/WriteReadData/mediafiles/image/lat_ki_masjid_2.jpg" alt="lat ki masjid"></a>
    This mosque, known as Lat Ki Masjid was built by Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351-88 AD), is a unique example of Tughlaq architecture. The mosque is a combination of structures, L-shaped ablution tank and a Lat (Pillar). The mosque is built partly of red and buff sandstone and partly of rubble masonry having thick plaster. Possibly extricated from destroyed Hindu temples, the stone pillars with floral and geometrical designs engraved on them support the main arched openings of the mosque. The main prayer hall has nine bays consisting of arches supported on pillars. It has a carved qibla and a pulpit in the western wall. Within the courtyard in the north-east, there is a Lat (Pillar) and the mosque is named after it. The Lat, made of sandstone, is a part of an Ashokan pillar. A few letters in Mauryan Brahmi script can be seen at the top, while in the lower portion, names of a few individuals/pilgrims have been inscribed on a subsequent date.
